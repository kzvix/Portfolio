         Design Process

      </h1>

       <p>
       At the beginning, I created 2 stages of the same face in Illustrator with a 400px * 400px grid (see attached images below), and then I recreated them on P5. I then started to experiment with variables and the random function to add more variations to the shapes. To make it easier to find the 2 faces I created, I instructed the viewer where to move or press the mouse with text and marks, which can be seen when a key is pressed. Asides from the key pressed function, I also incorperated the mouseX and mouseY function so that multiple variations of the face can be seen when the viewer move the mouse on the canvas.

        Reflection

       <p>
       At the beginning, I was struggling to find ways to transform the shape of the mouth from an ellipse (face 1) to an rectangle (face 2), and also to ensure the face doesn't get too compressed and remain visible while the mouse moves to different edges. Fortunately, I found ways to solve the problems by including functions and adjusting numbers. For instance, I discovered the keypressed/mousepressed function in which I can transform the shapes directly from the ellipse to the rectangle while multiple variations of face can still be seen. I also adjusted the numbers several times to achieve my desired results, making sure the sketch works from wherever the mouse is moved. Overall, this is an interesting assignment to learn and experiment with variables and functions including the random, MouseX/MouseY, and key/mouse pressed.
