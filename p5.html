       <p>
    For this assignment, I had Connor's head, Kushi's body and apple juice, and Yulia's legs. I was able to create differnt shapes in p5 using rectangles and ellipses execpt for the legs since they have a lot of curves, so I decided to draw it in illustrator first and then convert it into beziervertex. I also paid attention to strokes since some parts have strokes but some does not.

  This is Max. He lives on planet Leo. His father is a robot, and his mother is an octopus. He loves apple juice, so he always carries one with him. Recently, he's trying not to drink too much apple juice because he wants to lose weight.

       <p>
I think this is an interesting assignment. I did struggle a bit when I was creating the legs, but fortunetely I was able to recreate them. I also like the Pseudo code my partners provided so that my code can be more organized and also have directions on how to recreate the shapes.
